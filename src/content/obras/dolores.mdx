Overvaluing the razzle-dazzle to the extreme, these three acrobats approach the exhibition of their bodies and movements with an exaggerated coldness. They are connected within their expertise and their adoration for special effects. This harmony is broken by a deep irony that articulates them in a stochastic performance, while the acrobats become contradictorily, albeit meticulously conscious about the randomness of their actions.\

Aghast shivers in your brains and intended incomprehension are inevitable reactions seeing this act that never hides anything, that presents itself so parodistic that it becomes serious.\
